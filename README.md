Adventure Sales Dashboard – Power BI Project

Hi there,

Thanks for checking out my Power BI project. This dashboard was built using the AdventureWorks dataset and showcases how data can be transformed into clear, actionable insights for business decision-making.

Project Summary

The goal of this project was to analyze sales performance from multiple perspectives – time, geography, product category, and customer behavior. It helps answer important questions like:

- What are the top-performing regions and product categories?
- How are our sales trending month over month or year over year?
- Who are our top customers?
- What’s driving profit and where can we improve?

What’s Included in the Project

The dashboard highlights:

- Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity as key performance indicators
- Sales trends over time using line and bar charts
- Top products and regions
- Customer segmentation and behavior patterns
- Drill-through functionality for deeper insights at the product level
- YoY and MoM growth metrics using DAX
- Row-level security to control data access by region

Tools and Techniques Used

This project was built in Power BI Desktop and connected to sample Excel data. I used Power Query to clean and shape the data, and DAX to build all key metrics and time intelligence calculations. The model includes relationships between multiple tables to support flexible filtering and exploration.

Files in This Project

- Adventure_Sales.pbix – the main Power BI dashboard file  
- Screenshots folder (optional) – visuals of the dashboard layout

How to Use It

To explore the dashboard, simply download the `.pbix` file and open it in Power BI Desktop. You can interact with the visuals, filter by date or category, and dive deeper using the drill-through features.

Why I Built This

I created this project as a way to apply and demonstrate core Power BI skills in a real-world context. It combines data modeling, DAX, visualization, and report design in a way that delivers clear business value.
